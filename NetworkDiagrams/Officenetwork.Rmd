# Exploring our Network

## Overview

What are the most general characteristics of this network?

```{r}
UKfaculty
```

Does the graph has multiple edges per pair of nodes? Does the graph have any loops?

```{r}
is.simple(UKfaculty)
```

# Your turn!

Explore the karate network
How many nodes does the network have?
Is the network directed or undirected?
What vertex and edge attributes does the network have?

```{r}
data(karate)
karate
```

# Taking a closer look: Network Attributes

# Your turn!

Let's take a closer look at the karate network! 

Running this code will tell us the general characteristics of the network and the name of its attributes. 

```{r}
karate
```

Replace every [xxx] in the following code to answer each question. 

How many factions does the karate network have? 
How many nodes belong to each faction?

```{r}
table(V(karate)$[xxx])
```

Which nodes nominated Mr. Hi?

```{r}

neighbors(karate, "Mr Hi", mode = [xxx])

```

Which nodes nominated John A?

```{r}
[xxx](karate, "John A", mode = "in")
```

How many nodes nominated both Mr Hi and John A?

```{r}

mh <- neighbors([xxx], "Mr Hi", mode = [xxx])
ja <- neighbors([xxx], "John A", mode = [xxx])

sum(mh %in% ja)

```

Is there an edge between Mr Hi and John A?

```{r}
E(karate)["Mr Hi" [xxx] "John A"]
```

# Network Visualization 

Basic plot

```{r}
#setting wider margins
par(mar=no_marg)

#basic plot
plot(UKfaculty)
```

Option 1: Setting visual properties outside the plot function

We add attributes to the network

Step 1 Set vertex and/or edge attributes

```{r}

# vertex properties 
V(UKfaculty)$color <- "#88398A"

# vertex label properties
V(UKfaculty)$label.color <- "white"
V(UKfaculty)$label.cex <- 0.5

# edge properties
E(UKfaculty)$color <- "gray"

```

Step 2 Plot network

```{r}

plot(UKfaculty)

```

Option 2 Setting visual properties inside the plot function

We use the function arguments

```{r}

plot(UKfaculty, 
     # === vertex properties 
     vertex.color = "#88398A",
     vertex.frame.color = "#88398A",
     vertex.size = 9,
     # === vertex label properties
     vertex.label.cex = 0.5,
     vertex.label.color = "white",
     vertex.label.family = "Helvetica",
     # === edge properties
     edge.color = "gray",
     edge.width = 0.5,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.2)
```


This help us add different visual properties to subsets of edges or nodes. 

Coloring nodes by group

```{r}
table(V(UKfaculty)$Group)

mycolors <- c("black", 
              "#D3D3D3", 
              "#88398A", 
              "white", 
              "#562457")
mylabcols <- c("white", "black", "white", "black", "white")

V(UKfaculty)$color <- mycolors[V(UKfaculty)$Group]
V(UKfaculty)$frame.color <- mycolors[V(UKfaculty)$Group]
V(UKfaculty)$label.color <- mylabcols[V(UKfaculty)$Group]

plot(UKfaculty)
```

We can also combine both options. This is usually what we do. 

```{r}
plot(UKfaculty,
     vertex.size = 9,
     # === vertex label properties
     vertex.label.family = "Helvetica",
     # === edge properties
     edge.width = 0.5,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.1)
```


Coloring specifc edges

```{r}
E(UKfaculty)$color <- "gray"
E(UKfaculty)$color[E(UKfaculty)[47%--%28]] <- "#88398A"

plot(UKfaculty, 
     # === vertex properties 
     vertex.size = 9,
     # === vertex label properties
     vertex.label.cex = 0.5,
     vertex.label.family = "Helvetica",
     # === edge properties
     edge.width = 0.5,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.1)

```
